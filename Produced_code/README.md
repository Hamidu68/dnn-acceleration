### Store produced code after running run.py (for now, just software code)  

The name of the folder is the name of the network(the model that we are using)  
   
By running run.py, the c code of that network is created in the folder.  

In each folder, {model_name}.cpp file is created.  

( for example, if we use vgg16 model, by running run.py and passing parameters, vgg16.cpp file is created in vgg16 folder.)
